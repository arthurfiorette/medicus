# OpenTelemetry <Badge type="warning" text="Third-Party" />

OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that provides tools, APIs, and SDKs to generate, collect, and export telemetry data, allowing you to monitor your application's behavior and performance.

The `openTelemetryMedicusPlugin` simplifies OpenTelemetry integration by automatically configuring it for your application. With just a simple import and plugin registration, users can gain full access to distributed tracing, enabling seamless monitoring with any OpenTelemetry-compatible backend.

This plugin eliminates the need for manual instrumentation or additional boilerplate, providing a smooth and hassle-free observability solution.

## Example of usage

```ts
import { Medicus, HealthStatus } from 'medicus';
import { openTelemetryMedicusPlugin } from 'medicus/otel.js';

const medicus = new Medicus({
  plugins: [openTelemetryMedicusPlugin()],
  checkers: {
    async database() {
        return HealthStatus.HEALTHY
    }
  },
});
```

Once integrated, the attributes, traces, and other telemetry data generated by the `openTelemetryMedicusPlugin` should appear in your observability tool.
